# üì∑ Shutterdog
Film camera shutter chronograph made with Arduino.

The project was inspired by [this article](http://www3.telus.net/public/rpnchbck/shutter%20speed%20tester.html) about measuring shutter speed of vintage Kiev-3 camera. Its author uses a laser, a phototransistor and an oscilloscope to manually measure the time interval of the shutter. You can see pictures of the entire pfocess and of measuring device itself.

I chose to use the `BPW34` photodiode instead, the fastest I could find on the local market. And then I added `LM393P` comparator to make thing more digestible for Arduino.
The final scheme looks like this:

The code returns measuring results in milliseconds. You will need `eRCaGuy_Timer2_Counter` library to run it. [Get it here.](https://gumroad.com/l/eRCaGuy_Timer2_Counter)
It's recommended to repeat the measurement on each shutter speed at least three times.
Finally it's convenient to put results in a table like this:

<table>

<td>Model: **Smena-8M**</td>

<tr colspan="4">
